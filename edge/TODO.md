## Timeline and Priorities
1. Complete GitHub Actions Implementation (High Priority)
2. Monitoring Dashboard Integration (High Priority)
3. Smart Scheduling System (Medium Priority)
4. Device-Specific CI/CD Pipelines (Medium Priority)
5. Scalability Features (Lower Priority)

## Notes
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing setups
- Maintain performance optimization focus
- Keep security considerations in mind
- Regular testing throughout implementation
